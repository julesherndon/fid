    <h2> Low and Slow </h2>
    <p> This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technigue called sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. 
        In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching. </p>
    <p> Next Month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</i></b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
